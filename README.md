# ENVI5809 Group 7


Scientific question / hypothesis:

How will changes in future environmental factors affect the monthly abundance of Crown-of-thorns starfish and Coral trout in the Great Barrier Reef area?


Data set：
environmental factors from ereef：https://extraction.ereefs.aims.gov.au/

COTS and coral trout data from AIMS：https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/5bb9a340-4ade-11dc-8f56-00008a07204e


Analysis Plan：

This study will integrate the environmental factors of eReefs with the AIMS monitoring data of fish and benthic organisms, and establish a COTS and coral trout abundance prediction model based on SARIMAX.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to extract the main environmental gradients, and seasonal predictions are made under the synthetic climate scenarios.

The final output includes time series prediction results, uncertainty ranges, and visualized scenarios for the period 2019-2023.
